# Redux in React

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React for managing application state. In this project, Redux is utilized to handle the state of the application in a more efficient and scalable way. It helps in maintaining a single source of truth for the state, making it easier to debug and test the application.

Key concepts used in this project:
- **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state.
- **Reducers**: Functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.
- **Store**: The object that brings actions and reducers together, holding the application's state.

By using Redux, this project aims to achieve a more organized and maintainable codebase, especially as the application grows in complexity.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented Redux to manage the state of a React application. The key tasks accomplished include:
- Setting up the Redux store to hold the application's state.
- Creating actions to represent state changes.
- Writing reducers to handle actions and update the state accordingly.
- Connecting React components to the Redux store to access and modify the state.

This setup ensures a clear separation of concerns and makes the application easier to scale and maintain.
